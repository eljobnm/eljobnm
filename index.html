        <h2>What makes DADDY Apdo/Dopa's Twisted Fate so good?</h2>
        <p>
          The single most important factor why <b>Apdo</b> is such a great TF,
          is that he understands the game at an incredibly deep level and reads
          it extremely well. He punishes every wrong decision and TF excells at
          punishing overextending lanes, and snowballing the whole team. Apdo is
          not a mechanical god like faker, he just has a great feeling for how
          this game works.<br />
          His game sense is what makes him such a great player. He has a full
          understanding of the flow of the game and knows exactly what he should
          be doing to maximise his potential to win.
